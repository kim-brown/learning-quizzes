# learning-quizzes

Follow along with me as I learn cloud technologies including Kafka, Cassandra, Redis, and Elasticsearch! These quizzes/ materials are suitable for any background level, but I am especially gearing them towards fellow junior engineers. 

Each file will contain short "cliff notes" summaries of things I've learned as a newbie to these technologies. More importantly, it contains links to useful learning resources I've found along the way, such as original documentation, YouTube videos, and articles. Each "module" is lightweight and was built to be completed in 20-40 minutes. Though, hopefully, they can send you down a rabbithole of learning about these tools wherever curiosity takes you! 

Feedback/ corrections/ requests/ pointers to more information are always appreciated! Feel free to reach out at kim.brown.2442@gmail.com
