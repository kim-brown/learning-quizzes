# Elasticsearch learning resources for fellow newbies
Welcome! Join me in learning Elasticsearch, which is currently the most popular search engine out there. The series of modules below will guide you through Elasticsearch 7.15 documentation, as well as videos and articles I've found useful, all the while letting you check your understanding with short graded quizzes.

## Module 1: Intro to key concepts & usecases
**Summary:** Elasticsearch is an open-source, scalable, highly popular search engine. It's found in many a tech stack within SaaS and other cloud-based tech companies. Some say ES is easy to get started with, but tough to master. Other than for searching, you might use Elasticsearch for creating data reports, providing dashboards, or projecting future traffic/ sales through machine learning. The core value of ES is availability: we need data *fast*, in near real-time, and extremely efficient searching, sorting, and filtering. Indexes are collections of documents which contain fields: documents usually correspond to one entity/item, such as a specific person or a specific item in the store, while fields store information about that item, like its ID and its name. You can create and update documents by sending JSON, and even write queries in a JSON-like Elasticsearch language: Query DSL.
